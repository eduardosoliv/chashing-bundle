Developing
=============================

Flow
------------

If you want to contribute:

* fork;
* create branch;
* clone;
* install composer;
* php composer.phar install --dev;
* make your changes and run the tests: phpunit
* commit and push
* pull request (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

Coding standards
------------

PSR-*

Testing
------------

I'm using PHPunit 3.7.* to test the code.

All new code should have tests.
